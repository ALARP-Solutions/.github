ALARP Solutions is a boutique management consultancy that specialises in providing governance, risk management and systems safety solutions. ALARP Solutions is committed to supporting private and government organisations seeking to implement credible and robust risk and safety management frameworks, policies and practices that improve business outcomes, whilst also complying with legislation and adopted standards.

We have grown from providing systems safety solutions to a broader whole-of-enterprise approach to risk management. This growth is based on our experience that safety management is unlikely to be appropriate or effective until it is properly considered and supported in a whole of enterprise governance and risk management context. The need for an improved enterprise governance perspective is also recognised and driven through contemporary legislation.
